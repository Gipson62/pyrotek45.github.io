# Writing Analysis Report: "How to be Wise"

## Overview
Your blog post has a strong, conversational voice and engaging personality. The ideas flow well, and you tackle complex philosophical concepts in an accessible way. However, there are consistent patterns in your writing that could be refined to make your work more polished and easier to read.

---

## Error Patterns & Improvements

### 1. **Punctuation & Spacing**
**Problem:** Inconsistent spacing around punctuation, especially with commas and periods.

**Examples from your draft:**
- "tsk tsk tsk" → should be "tsk, tsk, tsk" (commas needed in series)
- "Well none of this would mean much if you did it for 20 minutes, and went back to binging tik tok videos" → awkward comma placement
- Missing spaces after punctuation in some places

**How to improve:** Proofread by reading sentences aloud. Your ear will catch awkward pauses and help you identify where punctuation is needed.

---

### 2. **Capitalization Inconsistencies**
**Problem:** You tend to lowercase proper nouns and the start of sentences when they should be capitalized.

**Examples:**
- "socrates" → "Socrates"
- "god" → "God"
- "santa claus" → "Santa Claus"
- "bible belt" → "Bible Belt"
- "america" → "America"
- "mark twain" → "Mark Twain"
- "fortnite" → "Fortnite"

**How to improve:** Do a final pass specifically looking for proper nouns. Create a style guide for yourself so you're consistent about whether you capitalize philosophical concepts like "Doubt" or "Faith."

---

### 3. **Contractions & Colloquial Language**
**Problem:** Mixing very informal contractions with more formal philosophical language. This isn't necessarily bad (it fits your voice), but be intentional about it.

**Examples:**
- "im" → "I'm"
- "youre" → "you're"
- "thats" → "that's"
- "dont" → "don't"
- "cant" → "can't"

**How to improve:** Always use contractions correctly. When you write fast, contractions are often where typos sneak in. Use your editor's spell-check to catch these automatically.

---

### 4. **Run-On Sentences**
**Problem:** You occasionally string together too many ideas with commas instead of breaking them into separate sentences.

**Example:**
- "Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying to just throw away everything you believe today like last week's salad, but I am saying you should let yourself explore the possibility that your beliefs or baseline assumptions might not be true."

This is borderline, but could be tighter.

**How to improve:** If a sentence has more than two "and's" or "but's," consider breaking it into two sentences. Shorter sentences can emphasize key points better.

---

### 5. **Tense Consistency**
**Problem:** Occasional shifts between past and present tense within the same thought.

**Example:** "I would argue its better to hold no belief, than a false one, since beliefs are what drive your actions" (shifts from past conditional to present)

**How to improve:** When telling a story, maintain the tense. When giving general advice, stick to present tense throughout a paragraph.

---

### 6. **Word Choice & Phrasing**
**Problem:** Some phrases are wordy or redundant.

**Examples:**
- "grow and up" → "grow up" (typo)
- "try to do it" → "try to make it a habit" (tighten the phrasing)
- "when you're 60, (if you make it that far)" → could use em-dash or just parentheses, not both
- "now has he?" → modern readers expect "has he now?" or just "now, has he?"

**How to improve:** When you finish a section, do a second pass reading for redundancy. Ask: "Can I say this in fewer words without losing meaning?"

---

### 7. **Comma Splices**
**Problem:** Occasionally joining independent clauses with commas instead of periods or semicolons.

**Example:**
- "I don't know, maybe they'll read this blog" → This is borderline, but "I don't know. Maybe they'll read this blog" is cleaner.

**How to improve:** The rule of thumb: if you can put a period between two clauses and they still make sense, use a period.

---

### 8. **Inconsistent Formatting**
**Problem:** Some lists use dashes, some use bullets. Some have colons, some don't.

**Example:** In Chapter 2, you have:
- Bullet points with em-dashes
- Then later, sentences starting with emphasized words

**How to improve:** Create a style guide for your own writing. Decide: Do I use em-dashes or parentheses for asides? Do I capitalize the first word after a colon? Stick to it.

---

### 9. **Missing Articles**
**Problem:** Occasionally dropping "a" or "the" where they're needed for clarity.

**Example:**
- "Its better to be unconvinced about something" → "It's better to be unconvinced about something"
- "Being young, what I would end up doing" → "Being young, what I'd end up doing" or "When I was young..."

**How to improve:** Read sentences aloud. Ears catch missing articles naturally.

---

### 10. **Parallelism in Lists**
**Problem:** When you have a list of related items, they should follow the same grammatical structure.

**Example:**
- "Go read some books, see the world using your new perspective, and make the world a better place" works, but could be tighter.

**How to improve:** Check that all items in a list start the same way (all verbs, all nouns, etc.).

---

## Strengths to Keep

1. **Voice:** Your conversational tone is genuine and engaging. Don't lose that.
2. **Humor:** The aside about calories, the fortnite reference, the casual "tsk tsk tsk"—these work.
3. **Structure:** Your bucket metaphor is clear and threads through the whole essay nicely.
4. **Honesty:** You admit when you're wrong or going on tangents. That's refreshing.
5. **Accessibility:** You take complex philosophy and make it understandable.

## Action Plan for Next Blog Post

**Before publishing:**

1. **Grammar pass:** Use a tool like Grammarly or just read aloud slowly.
2. **Capitalization pass:** Scan for proper nouns specifically.
3. **Contractions pass:** Search for "im ", "youre ", "thats " to catch these automatically.
4. **Sentence length:** Highlight sentences longer than 30 words and ask if they can be split.
5. **Consistency check:** Make sure your style is consistent (capitalization, punctuation, formatting).
6. **Read aloud:** This catches 80% of issues naturally.

---

## Summary

Your writing is **strong conceptually** but needs **polish in execution**. The errors are mostly mechanical (spelling, punctuation, capitalization) rather than structural. This is good news because these are the easiest things to fix with a simple proofreading system.

**Quick wins:**
- Always use spell-check (catches contractions and capitalization)
- Read sentences aloud before finalizing
- Use a style guide or checklist for your own writing habits

Keep writing. Your voice is worth hearing, and with a solid proofreading pass, these pieces will shine even brighter.
